Feature: Write about the actual sensor value
  As a journalist
  I want to include the actual value of a sensor in a text component
  So I can tell the reader that a particular value of e.g. 970 hPa is quite low

  Background:
    Given there is a sensor live report

  Scenario: Include markup in text component
    Given for my current report I have these text components prepared:
      | Sensor    | From  | To    | Text Component                               |
      | Temp123   | 30°C  | 40°C  | Wow, it's incredible { Temp123 }!            |
      | Bright456 | 70000 | 90000 | Take your sunglasses: { Bright456 } outside! |
    And the latested sensor data looks like this:
      | Sensor    | Calibrated Value |
      | Temp123   | 32°C             |
      | Bright456 | 85000 Lux        |
    When I visit the landing page
    Then I should see:
    """
    Wow, it's incredible 32°C! Take your sunglasses: 85000 Lux outside!
    """
